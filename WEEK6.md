# 🎮 WEEK6 Feminist Game Case Analysis  
* Her Story • The Game: The Game • GRIS*

This section summarises key feminist game works and analyses how they challenge traditional gendered narrative structures. These cases directly inform the design of biased narrative nodes in this project.

## 1. *Her Story* (2015) — Fragmented Testimony & the Erasure of Female Subjectivity

Sam Barlow’s *Her Story* uses a database-search mechanic to reconstruct a woman’s narrative through fragmented interview clips.  
Key insights:
- The system filters what the player can access → **power shapes narrative visibility**  
- Female subjectivity appears only through **incomplete, edited testimony**  
- Truth emerges from **absences**, highlighting institutional control  

**Relevance:**  
Shows how narrative fragmentation can reveal gendered power structures—informing decision-based EEG task design.

## 2. *The Game: The Game* (Washko, 2016) — Experiencing Power Inequality

Angela Washko’s interactive artwork simulates PUA (pick-up artist) language and coercive tactics.  
Players must navigate:
- Manipulative dialogue  
- Emotional pressure  
- Social power imbalance  

**Relevance:**  
Demonstrates that **interaction itself can be an oppressive mechanism**, not just content—guiding the construction of biased dialogue choices.

## 3. *GRIS* (2018) — Non-Sexualised Representation & Internal Narratives

*GRIS* avoids the male gaze entirely by presenting a non-sexualised female character whose story revolves around healing and emotional recovery.  
Distinctive features:
- **Soft, symbolic visual design** free from objectification  
- Emotional progression expressed through **color, movement, and space**  
- Prioritises **female interiority**, not service to male narrative arcs  

**Relevance:**  
Illustrates how visual language can be decoupled from gender stereotypes—informing how the project constructs visual cues for bias.

## 📌 Summary of Insights for This Project
Across these feminist works, several shared mechanisms emerge:

- **Restricted female agency** → reproduced in RPG bias tasks  
- **Narrative driven by male-centric goals** → basis for biased plot prototypes  
- **Emotional labour assigned to women** → used to construct evaluation tasks  
- **System-filtered female voices (Her Story)** → maps onto EEG event-locked moments  
- **Interaction-as-oppression (The Game: The Game)** → informs coercive choice structures  
- **De-sexualised visual representation (GRIS)** → contrasts conventional RPG gendering  

These analyses directly support the design of the project’s three measurable task types:  
**choice tasks, evaluation tasks, and judgement tasks** tied to biased narrative stimuli.

# Week9
# Visual Style Research & Concept Sketch Development
## “female characters being controlled, manipulated, or objectified.”

### 1.1 Reference: Karakuri (Karakuri Puppet Mechanisms)

- Mechanical, segmented motion → reinforces the feeling of non-autonomy  
- Exposed joints and mechanisms → strong metaphor for systemic surveillance/control  
- Cold, ritualistic aesthetics → aligns with the game’s oppressive worldbuilding

### 1.2 Reference: 20th-Century Puppet Theatre

- Visible strings, rods, and stage frames → explicit symbols of power hierarchy  
- Puppet = inherently “controlled body,” fitting the narrative of structural dominance  
- Aged textures, chipped paint, worn wood → emphasize deterioration and disposability

### 1.3 Reference: *GIRLS* (side-scrolling female narrative game)
![image](https://git.arts.ac.uk/user-attachments/assets/3e25ced3-98a9-4d65-b601-e15178a66edb)

- Side-scroll format simplifies the framing of “being watched / being directed”  
- Strong thematic resonance with women’s constrained roles in narrative structures  
- Minimal mechanics yet emotionally dense → inspiring for this project’s direction

## 2. Concept Sketch Established: Puppet Theatre as the Visual Backbone
# Based on this research, I created the initial visual concept sketches this week.

### 2.1 Core Idea
> The visual identity draws from mid-20th-century puppet theatre to depict female  
> characters as controlled, performed, and manipulated bodies.
>Orange–yellow resembles the warm tungsten spotlights commonly used in mid-20th-century puppet stages. This immediately builds a sense of “being on display,” reinforcing the idea that the characters are performing under an external gaze.

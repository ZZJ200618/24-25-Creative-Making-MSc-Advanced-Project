## ✅ Summary
The Prevalence of Gendered Narrative Structures in Games
Over the past few decades, gender representation in digital games has been an important topic in game research. Content analysis indicates that mainstream RPGS often rely on sexualizing, weakening, and marginalizing female characters to construct their narratives (Dietz, 1998; Behm-Morawitz & Mastro, 2009). In these works, female characters are usually not the narrative subjects but rather serve as emotional supporters, sacrificial figures, or auxiliary entities that drive the male protagonist's plot. Feminist critiques, such as Sarkeesian's (2013) "Tropes vs Women in Video Games", further reveal how these stereotypical patterns replicate the gender power structure in the real world in the digital space. Classic RPGs such as "The Legend of Zelda" and "Final Fantasy VII" have long been regarded as typical examples of the "hero saves the princess" narrative paradigm, in which the male protagonist gives the story meaning, while the female character is positioned as a secondary or dependent character.

Narrative Innovation and Limitations of Feminist Games 
In response to this structural issue, feminist game creators have proposed alternative narrative approaches, challenging traditional paradigms by highlighting female initiative or exposing gender power inequality. Washko's (2016) "The Game: The Game" replicates the real "PUA script", allowing players to directly immerse themselves in manipulative language and violent structures, thereby experiencing gendered interactive power inequality. GRIS (2018) presented the emotional and traumatic journeys of women in a non-sexualized way, while "Her Story" (2015) revealed the restricted positions of women in the family and judicial systems through fragmented database images. However, most of these studies rely on text analysis or player self-reports, making it difficult to capture players' immediate attention or emotional responses when facing biased narratives. Therefore, players' experiences often remain at the level of post-event recollection, lacking evidence of real-time mental activity.

Player narrative experience and cognitive processing
Narrative psychology research indicates that narrative experience is essentially accompanied by processes of attention regulation, value judgment, and emotional resonance. Green & Brock (2000) proposed the cognitive model of "narrative immersion", arguing that immersion is not only an emotional experience but also a process of deep attention engagement. In video games, players not only read the narrative but also "execute the narrative", so their cognitive load is more complex (Lu et al., 2012). When players are faced with inconsistent or value-conflicting plots, their attention resources will be redistributed (Bopp et al., 2018). Narrative situations related to gender, identity, and social prejudice can trigger players' psychological defenses, self-positioning, and value judgments (Harrell, 2019).

The Application of EEG in Game Research
In recent years, EEG has been widely applied in emotion computing to measure the attention, emotional load and cognitive conflict of subjects. Studies have shown that beta waves (13-30Hz) are associated with concentration and cognitive processing, alpha waves (8-12Hz) reflect attention inhibition and information switching, while theta waves (4-7Hz) are often related to emotional activation and memory processing (Wan Ismail, Hanif & Hamzah, 2016). Due to the millisecond-level sampling speed of EEG, it can capture immediate and continuous psychological changes, and it has significant advantages in interactive studies. However, existing EEG multimedia research mainly focuses on medical and criminal investigation scenarios, with few involving narrative bias, gender discrimination, or unequal role presentation game applications. Therefore, the immediate cognitive responses generated by players in biased narratives still require systematic measurement methods.

Existing Problem
Although existing research has revealed gender-stereotyped narratives in games and a large number of EEG studies have been used to measure attention and emotional changes, these two fields have long been separated. Most of the existing analyses on feminist games rely on text studies or player interviews, making it difficult to capture the immediate cognitive responses of players when facing biased narratives. EEG applications are mostly concentrated in the fields of healthcare, education and emotion recognition, and are rarely used in narrative bias situations. Moreover, there is a lack of visualization methods with "narrative semantics". Therefore, a small number of studies have combined gender bias narrative, real-time EEG measurement and dynamic audio-visual visualization to reveal the cognitive activities of players when bias is triggered

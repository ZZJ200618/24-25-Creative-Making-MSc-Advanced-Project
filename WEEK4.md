## Week 4 — Deep Research on the Bechdel Test & Its Extension to Games

This week’s focus was to:
- conduct a detailed analysis of what kinds of **scenes, dialogues, and narrative structures** fail the Bechdel Test  
- extend these logics into **game design**, referencing uploaded academic papers  
- rethink the installation’s video-based stimuli into an **interactive narrative game**, inspired by Patchwork Girl  
- design a narrative system using **the female body as structural navigation**  

These insights will inform the next stage of prototyping in TouchDesigner + Unity.

## 1. What Types of Scenes and Dialogues Fail the Bechdel Test?

From close analysis of Bechdel & relevant gender-media research, the following patterns consistently lead to failure:

### **1.1 Women appear but never speak**
- Female characters exist only visually (assistants, background nurses, helpers)  
- They accompany men but have no names or voice  

### **1.2 Women only speak *about men***  
Classic examples include:
- talking about boyfriends, male heroes, male bosses, male fears  
- reacting to male action rather than generating their own  

This reveals a structural dependence on male-centered agency.

### **1.3 Female characters are framed only through emotional labor**
- comforting male characters  
- reacting to male trauma  
- supporting men’s arcs while lacking inner life  

### **1.4 Conversations that look like “female dialogue” but still center men**  
Often disguised as:
- “How do you feel about him?”  
- “Should we tell him?”  
- “He won’t understand us.”  

### **1.5 Women exist mainly as plot devices**
- The love interest who inspires the male lead  
- The victim whose suffering motivates male revenge  
- The helper who delivers exposition and disappears  

These patterns reinforce **women as narrative tools, not narrative subjects**.

##  2. Extending Bechdel Logic to Game Design

### ✔ **2.1 Character Development**  
Does a female character have her own arc, conflict, and decision-making?

### ✔ **2.2 Appearance & Stereotypes**  
Is her visual design justified by narrative/context, not reduced to sexualization?

### ✔ **2.3 Active Role in Main Story**  
Is she essential to the main narrative rather than optional content?

### ✔ **2.4 Extends Beyond One or Two Tropes**  
Does she transcend predictable stereotypes?

These game-specific criteria reveal *interactive dynamics* that films don’t have.

## 3. How the Bechdel Framework Reveals Bias *Unique to Games*

Based on IRWiG and broader representation studies:

### **3.1 Optional Content Bias**
Games frequently hide female character development behind sidequests.  
→ This creates a situation where many players may *never encounter* meaningful female agency.

### **3.2 Player-Controlled Gaze**
Unlike film, players choose where to look.  
This exposes:
- objectifying camera angles  
- mechanics that encourage players to treat women as collectibles or tools  
- avatar designs shaped by male-centered viewer fantasy  

### **3.3 Interactivity Creates “Skippable Representation”**
Game narratives can allow:
- skipping conversations  
- bypassing scenes  
- choosing male characters only  

→ Representation becomes *conditional* instead of structural.

### **3.4 Game Mechanics Enforce Stereotypes**
Combat types, abilities, and gameplay loops often reinforce:
- women = ranged / healing / support  
- men = strength / leadership / heroic roles  

This stereotyping is systemic and mechanical—not just narrative.

## 4. Reflection

- The strongest emotional triggers are not just *what women say*, but *what they are allowed to do*.  
- Physiological signals (EEG stress index, HR arousal) will spike at moments of:  
  - female disempowerment  
  - objectification  
  - silence  
  - forced emotional labor  
  - stereotyped roles  

Thus, the Bechdel Test → IRWiG Test → Muse-based emotional mapping create a unified framework:

> “We measure how gendered narrative structure shapes the body.”

##  5. Patchwork Girl Inspiration — Turning Video Stimuli into an Interactive Narrative Game
### **Patchwork Girl Core Ideas**

- nonlinear, body-based navigation  
- fragmented, stitched identity  
- narrative as anatomical collage  
- feminist reappropriation of Frankenstein  

### Female Body as Narrative Interface**

You can construct the narrative via **five body zones** 

| Body Part | Narrative Function | Emotional Theme |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Eyes | The Look / objectifying gaze | Surveillance anxiety |
| Mouth | Silenced speech | Disempowerment |
| Heart | Emotional labor | Gendered caregiving |
| Hands | Utilitarian function | Toolification of female agency |
| Head | Erased intellect | “Mentor who disappears” trope |

This merges perfectly with your ongoing conceptual framework.

##  6. Week 4 Game Design Proposal — A Bechdel/IRWiG-Informed Interactive Narrative Game

### **Game Structure**
- The player navigates a fragmented female body (3D or illustrated)  
- Each body part opens an interactive narrative scene  
- The scenes are filled with situations that *fail* Bechdel / IRWiG criteria:
  - interrupted female conversations  
  - optional side-story female arcs that disappear  
  - women restricted to stereotypes  
  - dialogue branches where female agency is blocked  

### **EEG + HR Integration**
Muse measurements can determine:
- what scenes trigger stress / empathy  
- whether players respond differently based on gender  
- narrative branching influenced by physiological response  

### **Why This Works**
This transforms the installation into *an experiential critique* of gendered narrative structures:
- The player **performs** the process of navigating a misogynistic story space  
- The body metaphor makes structural violence *visible*  
- Physiological responses become part of narrative reconstruction

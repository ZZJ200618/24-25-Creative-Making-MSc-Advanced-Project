# Week 1
# **An Interactive TouchDesigner Installation Based on Heart-Rate Emotional Feedback**
## Progress summary

I want to make an interactive installation that uses TouchDesigner to observe and visualize how audiences of different genders produce different physiological and emotional responses when viewing the same set of socially charged images (e.g., gender stereotypes, surveillance gaze, body discipline).  
The project reveals that “watching” is not a neutral act—it is shaped by gender, culture, and lived experience.

## Project Overview
This installation collects the viewer’s **heart rate in real time**, maps physiological changes into **visual and auditory feedback**, and compares emotional responses across genders.

The system explores questions such as:

- How do men, women, and non-binary audiences react differently to the same social imagery?  
- How do physiological signals reflect internalized social conditions?  
- Can audiovisual feedback make invisible bias visible?

The project uses **TouchDesigner** as the primary medium

## Research Focus

During this week’s discussion with the advisor, the following directions were established:

### **1. Social Event Selection (to be finalized next meeting)**
The installation will be based on one representative social or prejudice-related event, such as:
- gendered surveillance gaze  
- idealized bodies & beauty standards  
- transgender visibility  
- media-created gender roles  

(Exact case will be chosen after further research and meeting.)

## Emotion Recognition Equipment

### **Instruments**
- Heart rate sensor (brand TBD)
- Number of devices: *to be decided based on testing environment and sample size*
- Accuracy requirements: must reliably detect small changes related to arousal, tension, and calmness

### **Reason for Using Heart Rate**
Heart rate correlates strongly with:
- anxiety / tension  
- attention / arousal  
- repression / calmness  
- emotional volatility  

Heart rate is non-intrusive and stable enough for installation-based emotion tracking.

## System Architecture

### **Separation of Spaces**
The advisor emphasized that:
- **Testing area** (participants viewing images)  
- **Audio-visual feedback area** (projection + sound)  

must be physically separated.

Reason: **light and sound directly influence emotions**, which would interfere with authentic physiological responses.

### Shared Gaze, Split Pulse — Thematic Map

| Theme                 | Visual Content Example                                           | Symbolic Meaning                                                    | Expected Gendered Response                                                                 |

| The Surveillance Gaze | A close-up of a male face behind a security camera              | Represents male gaze and panoptic observation                       | Women: increased heart rate (anxiety), Men: neutral or engaged                              |
| Idealized Bodies      | Photoshopped female bodies in commercial ads                    | Critique of beauty standards and body commodification               | Women: tension or self-conscious response, Men: neutral or attracted                        |
| Transgender Presence  | Portrait of a trans/non-binary person in a calm setting         | Challenges normative gender expectations                            | Men: potential discomfort or tension, Women: empathetic response                            |

## Next Meeting Goals

- Finalize the **specific social event** used as the narrative basis  
- Decide which **heart-rate recognition device** to purchase  
- Confirm **number of devices and measurement accuracy**  
- Refine spatial layout between testing and feedback zones

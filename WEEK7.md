#  Week 7
## Focus: Questionnaire Analysis + Semi-Structured Interviews  
This week focused on gathering empirical evidence on gender bias in RPG narratives through a 50-player questionnaire and four semi-structured interviews. The findings are used to construct measurable bias-narrative frameworks for later EEG task design.

### **2.2 Key Bias-Perception Findings**

| Bias Indicator | Percentage |
|----------------|------------|
| Appearance emphasised over ability | **66%** |
| Fixed into auxiliary/support roles | **58%** |
| Lacks independent goals | **42%** |
| Fantasy/historical settings amplify bias | **44%** |

**Emotional Impact Score:** 3.16 / 5  
(Indicates a significant emotional response to marginalised female characters.)

# 🎤 3. Semi-Structured Interviews (4 Participants)  
*Source: Interview Transcripts* :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### **3.1 Themes Extracted**
- Female characters often serve **decorative or instrumental roles**  
- Dialogue frequently revolves around male heroes  
- Recurring tropes identified:  
  - “Damsel in distress”  
  - Female sacrifice motivating male revenge arcs  
  - Emotional labour assigned to women  
- Lack of narrative agency:  
  > “Women aren’t narrators, but tools in the narrative chain.”

- highlight **patriarchal narrative traditions** + developers’ gender perspectives  
- Even “strong” female characters remain constrained by **male-centric logic**

# 4. Interpretation & Impact on Design

### **4.1 Bias Categories Identified**
Using combined quantitative + qualitative data, four structural bias frames were extracted:

1. **Functional weakening**  
2. **Plot instrumentalisation**  
3. **Visual gendering / over-emphasis on appearance**  
4. **Loss of narrative agency**

These categories are used to design **three EEG-compatible task structures**:
- **Choice tasks** (responding to biased dialogue)  
- **Evaluation tasks** (judging unfair depictions)  
- **Decision tasks** (acting under biased or incomplete information)

Each task is assigned a **time-locked EEG event window** to enable precise epoch segmentation.
